Disease Prediction Model
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict diseases based on symptoms. The project uses a cleaned dataset with no null values, and all features are binary (0's and 1's). We implement three classifiers:

Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
